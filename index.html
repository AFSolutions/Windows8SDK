  <h3>PayPal Checkout for Windows 8 Apps</h3>

  <p>Use the PayPal Checkout SDK (Win8XO) to add PayPal checkout functionality to your Windows 8 applications. </p>

  <p>The SDK is available as a
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh441572.aspx">Windows Runtime Component</a> for Store developers, allowing it to be used by apps
    written in a variety of languages. Phone developers can make use of the PayPal Checkout SDK for Windows 8 Phone that is available as a Portable Class Library.

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <h4>Step 1: Configure Your PayPal Account</h4>
  <p>The SDK processes PayPal transactions through a PayPal Premier or Business account which you'll configure to allow our Merchant account to
    process Express Checkout transactions on your behalf. This allows simple integration while protecting your API credentials from being exposed.</p>
  <p>To grant permissions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Log into your PayPal merchant account.</li>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Profile > My Selling Tools</strong> and click <strong>API Access > Update</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <em>Option 1: Grant API Permission</em></li>
    <li>Look up the account <strong>windowsstore_api1.paypal.com</strong> (or <strong>mswin_1352404208_biz_api1.paypal.com</strong> for a <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">Sandbox</a> account)</li>
    <li>Once the account is location, check both <em>Use Express Checkout</em> to process payments and <em>Use Express Checkout to process mobile payments</em>,
     then click OK.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>That's it! You're now ready to use the PayPal SDK.</p>

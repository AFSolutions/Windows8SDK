#PayPal Windows 8 Checkout SDK


The *PayPal Windows 8 Checkout SDK* gives you the ability to integrate a PayPal checkout
flow into your Windows 8 applications. The SDK is based on Mobile Express Checkout (MEC),
which offers an in-flow checkout experience in a reduced-display mode.

You can integrate the PayPal Checkout SDK into your applications using either C# or JavaScript. Store application developers can use the `PayPal.Checkout.vsix` file and phone developers the `PayPal.Checkout.SDK-WindowsPhone8.dll` file. See the following guides for details:
